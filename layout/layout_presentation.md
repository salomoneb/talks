# It’s Hip to Be Square: A Re-introduction to Web Layout 

## But Why
* Layout is not cool - there are a million other things that we could talk about. 
* Fundamentals often get dismissed in pursuit of the shiny thing (knowing the fundamentals can help you understand the shiny thing).
* Programmers are often quick to dismiss layout - and CSS in general - as secondary or irrelevant to their work. This is **false**.
* As web developers, we make things **for the web**. If you can throw around terms like “dependency injection” and “memoization,” but are overwhelmed at the prospect of styling a login page, then you are missing key skills. 

## Goals
* Familiarize ourselves with the fundamentals of web layout. 
* Understand the different ways that we can apply these technologies when building web pages.

## Let's Review
* The box model
* The `display` property
* Flow, floats, and positioning

These are the primary concepts governing layout in the [visual formatting model](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#visual-model-intro).
